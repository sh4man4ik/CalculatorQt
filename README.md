# Quick start
To try the calculator at once, you need to open the zipped folder (`CalculatorQt_zip`) and run the `CalculatorQt.exe` file.

# Calculator source code
If you are interested in the project code, it is located in the *CalculatorQt source code* folder. You can just run the *CalculatorQt.sln* file and the project will open in Visual Studio and we can run the code immediately. If you want to work with source code, you must have Qt framework installed.
